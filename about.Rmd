## About this app

The goal of this app is to help users to better understand the global climate model ensemble featured in Version 7 of [ClimateBC](http://climatebc.ca/) and [ClimateNA](http://climatena.ca/). These models are from the new generation of global climate model simulations, the sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), which will be featured in the upcoming 2021 IPCC sixth assessment report (AR6). CarbonBrief provides a good [explanation](https://www.carbonbrief.org/cmip6-the-next-generation-of-climate-models-explained) of CMIP6 and the global results. The focus of this app is on British Columbia.

### Methods

**Climate Variables**--The focus of this app is on comparison of observed and modeled temperature and precipitation. There are four climate elements available: Mean temperature (T<sub>ave</sub>), mean daily maximum temperature (T<sub>max</sub>), mean daily minimum temperature (T<sub>min</sub>), and Precipitation (PPT). Since historical station observations of temperature measure T<sub>min</sub> and T<sub>max</sub>, I used these as the primary temperature elements and calculated T<sub>ave</sub> as their average (see [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep04637) for an assessment of bias). 

**Emissions scenarios**--This app features climate model simulations from the ScenarioMIP project, which produces projections of future climate change based on scenarios called [Shared Socioeconomic Pathways](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-how-shared-socioeconomic-pathways-explore-future-climate-change). This app features the four major ScenarioMIP SSPs: SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5.  

**Regional averages**--There is essentially no downscaling in this app. All climate model data were bilinearly interpolated to a common 0.5^o grid derived from the 025^o ERA5 grid (see figure below). Plot values are the average of the grid points within the boundaries of BC or the user-selected ecoprovince.

**Observations**--Observed historical data are obtained from [ClimateBC](http://climatebc.ca/) for the gridpoints of the common grid shown in the Resolution tab. 

#### The Time Series tab

This tab allows users to compare model simulations to each other and to observations, and to produce customized exportable plots. 

**Ensemble range**--There are several simulation runs for each climate model. This app shows the range of these runs i.e., the minimum and maximum of the model runs in each year of the time series. The "Model Info" tab specifies the number of runs for each model. 

**Bias correction**--Bias correction is an option, defaulted "off", since one of the purposes of this app is to assess regional bias in each model and across the ensemble. When bias correction is turned on, each single-model ensemble is shifted so that its 1951-1980 ensemble mean matches the 1951-1980 mean of the observed time series. Bias correction is done by addition for temperature and multiplication for precipitation.  

**Compiled ensembles**--Users can compile selected models into a multi-model ensemble. In these plots, the shaded envelope shows the maxima and minima of all the single-model ensembles collectively, and the multimodel ensemble mean is the mean of the single-model ensemble means. 
 
#### The Change tab

This tab allows users to understand the differences among models in a two-variable climate space. The main application of this tab is selection of small ensembles for regional analysis. 

**Calculation of change**--Change in climate variables for each model is calculated relative to the model's simulated mean climate of the 1961-1990 reference period. This reference period mean is calculated from all available historical runs for each model. The change in each variable is the mean of all projected runs for the model within each scenario. Calculating change from multiple runs for each scenario reduces the uncertainty in the climate change signal due to natural variability. 

**Predefined order for reducing ensemble size**--In "Predefined" ensemble selection mode, each subset of the ensemble is selected using the method of [Cannon 2015](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/28/3/jcli-d-14-00636.1.xml) to best represent the spread of the full 13-model ClimateBC/NA ensemble across all time periods and scenarios. The order of model selection is unique to each ecoprovince. 

#### The Bias tab

This tab shows the bias of each model in each climate variable. Bias is the degree to which a model simulation differs from the observed climate over a reference period (1961-1990 in this case). Bias is an important consideration in selecting models for regional climate analysis, even where these biases are removed through bias correction. Bias correction as performed in ClimateBC disrupts the physical connection between climate variables, and the amount of these distortions increase with the size of the biases in the simulation. For this reason, models with small biases are preferable to models with large biases, all else being equal. 

**Calculation of bias**--Bias is calculated by subtracting (dividing for precipitation) the observed 1961-1990 climate from the simulated 1961-1990 climate for each model run. The bias for each model is the mean of the biases for all of the historical runs of that model. 

#### Selection of the ClimateBC/NA CMIP6 ensemble

As of December 2020, there were 44 global climate models contributing to the ScenarioMIP project. We selected a subset of 13 of these models for ClimateBC/NA based on the following criteria: 

1.	Minimum of 3 historical runs available; 
2.  T<sub>min</sub> and T<sub>max</sub> available;
3.	At least one run for each of the four main SSP marker scenarios;
4.	One model per institution;
5.	No closely related models, based on Fig. 5 in [Brunner et al. 2020](https://esd.copernicus.org/articles/11/995/2020/esd-11-995-2020.html); and 
6.	No large biases over BC

To provide context, this app includes all 19 models that met criteria 1-3 as of December 2020. 

**ECS of the ClimateBC/NA ensemble**--The 13-model ensemble has a mean global equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) of 3.7^(o)C and a range of 1.9-5.6^(o)C, which closely matches the full CMIP6 ensemble ECS (3.7^(o)C; 1.8-5.6^(o)C, [Meehl et al. 2020](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/advances/6/26/eaba1981.full.pdf)).
