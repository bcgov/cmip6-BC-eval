### Purpose

This guidance is developed by the BC Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development (FLNRORD) to provide best practices for users of ClimateBC and those evaluating projects prepared using ClimateBC data. This guidance is professional opinion and does not represent government policy. 

### Model Selection

There is broad scientific agreement that an ensemble of at least eight independent climate models are required to represent modeling uncertainties about climate change outcomes over large regions (Pierce et al. 2009, McSweeney et al. 2014, Cannon 2015, Wilcke and BÃ¤rring 2016). However, small ensembles of 3-5 GCMs may be adequate for studies that are limited to a small area or a single time of year. 

There is insufficient evidence to rank the GCM projections in terms of their realism for the BC climate. If a single representative projection is desired, the 13-GCM ensemble mean is likely more reliable than any single GCM projection (Pierce et al. 2009).
